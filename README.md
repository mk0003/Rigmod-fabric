# RigMod
Random Item Generator (RigMod) for Minecraft 1.16.3 Fabric

This mod adds "Random Item Generator" block. Every time you mine this block it will drop a random item. If you mine with a silk touch pickaxe it will drop itself. If you break with a fortune pickaxe it can drop multiple items at once.

Here is a example how this block works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD_K3jqE0Mk
